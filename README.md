# NWAeroGridashboard
This is a modern single-page dashboard remake of the NWA tracker in a vaporwave weather channel style. It uses a responsive grid for NWS weather, iDriveArkansas data, and ADS-B tracking while featuring dark mode, WASM decoding, and auto-refresh. It's a digital cockpit for regional awareness.
